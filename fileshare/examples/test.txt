Tracy was not a coder. In fact, the closest she’d ever come to coding was changing her Instagram bio. But one day, she decided it was time to step into the tech world. After all, how hard could it be to create a simple frontend UI? Spoiler alert: very hard.

Armed with a fresh installation of Visual Studio Code and a "Learn HTML in 24 Hours" book that she bought on a whim, Tracy set out to design what she thought would be the slickest, most user-friendly UI ever. In her head, it was going to look like Apple’s website—clean, modern, and sleek. But what actually happened was…well, it was more like a website from 1998. 

She started by Googling everything. “How to make a button.” “How to make a button do something.” “What’s CSS?” After several hours of staring blankly at her screen and scrolling through tutorials, Tracy’s code looked like a Jackson Pollock painting. There were divs within divs within divs, random inline styles that didn’t match, and an entire rainbow of font colors for reasons unknown even to her.

Finally, after what felt like a lifetime of debugging (she didn’t even know what debugging was before this day), her masterpiece was ready to launch. She hit refresh, expecting a glorious, interactive UI to grace her screen. Instead, she was greeted by…a giant red button. Nothing else. Just one huge, pixelated button in the middle of a blank page. And, for some reason, it said “SUBMIT” in Comic Sans.

Tracy stared at it in disbelief. “Well, at least it works,” she thought, and clicked the button. The whole screen froze, and then an error popped up that she had never seen before. Something about a “404” and a “broken link,” whatever that meant.

Determined to fix it, she messaged her tech-savvy friend Lisa. 

Lisa replied with, "You literally made the button too powerful."

"What do you mean *too powerful*?" Tracy asked, bewildered.

“You set the button to submit *everything* on the page. But there’s nothing on the page. So it’s submitting...nothing...forever.”

Tracy stared at her creation. It was the world’s most useless yet unstoppable button. She tried not to laugh, but eventually burst into a fit of giggles. “I think I’ve invented a new kind of chaos.”

Lisa replied, “You sure have. Stick to eating apples, Tracy.”CARS
